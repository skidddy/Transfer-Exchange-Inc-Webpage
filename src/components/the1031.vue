          <B>Whatâ€™s a 1031 Exchange ?</B>
        </v-card-title>Section 1031 of the tax code provides one of the best strategies for the deferral of capital gain taxes which would ordinarily arise from the sale of investment property. Exchanging defers the realization of the capital gain tax, leaving the property owner with substantially more proceeds to reinvest in a replacement property.

Examples of like-kind property can include: single family residential, multi-family residential, retail, manufacturing, condominiums, offices, industrial warehouses and bare land. As a general rule, real property is like-kind as to all other real property except: (1) An interest in a partnership (2) Primary residences and vacation and/or second homes (3) Inventory (defined as property held for sale).</v-card-text>
